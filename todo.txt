TODO:
- Empty stack should be a null pointer
    -> null Pointer shouldnt dereffernceable
    -> tos should point to the element and not above it
- stack should start at highest possible adress of the internal mem chunk, not at u64::MAX!
- define in all places where constants can appear (maybe??)
- use bos register


DONE:
- rename ParamOffsetStack and ParamStackConstant
- input syscall
- define
